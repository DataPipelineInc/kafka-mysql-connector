This is a simple copycat connector. This repo is intended to be a simple skeleton, that you can copy/paste to get started with developing your own copycat connector.

This repo contains a fork of the copycat-file plugin from Kafka trunk. The code itself has not changed. This things specific to this repo arethe build files, as well as the instructions in this README that tell you how to get started.

As of today (2015-10-15), Copycat has not been released in any official version of Kafka, so in order to run it and develop against it, we will need to work off of Kafka trunk.

Instructions for building
-------------------------
1. Pull down Kafka trunk.
   git clone https://github.com/apache/kafka kafka
2. Build kafka and place jars in local maven repo 
   (cd kafka && ./gradlew install)
3. Pull this repo down and build it
   git clone https://[path] copycat-file
   (cd copycat-file && ./gradlew build)

Instructions for running
------------------------
1. Run zookeeper somehow.
   Here are instructions on how to run it using docker.
   docker run -d --name zookeeper -p 2181:2181 confluent/zookeeper
2. Run the trunk version of Kafka.
   (cd kafka && ./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties)
3. Run your copycat plugin
   export CLASSPATH=/Users/jcheng/copycat-file/build/libs/copycat-file.jar
   kafka/bin/copycat-standalone.sh copycat-file/copycat-standalone.properties  copycat-file/copycat-file-urce.properties
